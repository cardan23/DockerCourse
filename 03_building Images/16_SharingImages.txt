Sharing Images on docker hub

To share an Image on docker hub we will do next steps:


1. Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/
2. Go to Repositories and click on "Create a repository"
3. Add a name (mandatory) and description (optional) and click on "create repository"

	In my case I used: carlosavilc/react-app

4. Back on terminal, create a build image:

	docker image build -t react-app:2 .

5. Add a tag to your image with your user name, something like this:

	docker image tag react-app:2 carlosavilc/react-app:2

6. Login docker
	
	docker login

7. Enter user and password
8. Push your image to docker hub

	docker push carlosavilc/react-app:2

9. Check on "https://hub.docker.com" if was already shared
10. create a new build image with new tag

	docker image build -t react-app:3 .

11. Check on "https://hub.docker.com" if was already shared too.


Please check the "16_ShareImages" directory and you will see the images about this result. 



You have shared your image on docker hub, well done!!!
