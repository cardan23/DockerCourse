Images and Containers


Images

An Image contains all what an application needs to work, just like:

	- A cut-down Operating system
	- Third party libraries
	- Application files
	- Environment variables
	- Configuration files
	- etc

	This is a set of thigs that makes an application can work with all dependencies and software needed.

Container

	A container is like a virtual machine, designed to allocate an application in a isolated way, the container have next things:
	
	- Provides an isolated environmnent
	- Can be stopped and restared
	- Is just a process
	- Is like an instance of the image.


We can have several containers (processes, instances) of the same image running and will be isolated and not necessary connected between.

To demonstrate please download the "Ubuntu" image and create 2 containers to notice, both are independent:

1. open a terminal window
2. docker run ubuntu
3. docker build -t ubuntu
4. docker run ubuntu
5. go to home, "cd ~"
6. create a file, touch myfile.txt

7. open another terminal window
8. docker run ubuntu
9. go to home, "cd ~"
10. Try to see all files and you will notice not exist any "myfile.txt" file. This means containers are isolated.




Now you can understand both concepts, well done!!!
