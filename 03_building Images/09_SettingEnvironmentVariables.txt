Setting Environment variables

Sometimes we need on our applications to set some environment variables, like API URLs. In this lesson we ae going to learn how to do that with commands in docker container.


open the "dockerfile" on the application in visual code and type the next command at the end of the file:

ENV API_URL=http://api.myapi.com/


ENV --> this command will let us create environment variables on our docker container


Open a terminal, go the app path and build your image again

	docker image build -t react-app .

Run your container in a interactive way
		
	docker run -it react-app sh

Check if the environment variable was created with next Linux commands learned into the previous module.
	
	We can check with some ways:

	1. printenv API_URL
	2. printenv
	3. echo $API_URL


You should see the value of the environment variable created.


You have created an environment variable in docker container, Well done!!
