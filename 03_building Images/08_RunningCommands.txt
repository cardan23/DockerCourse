Running Commands

Now in this lesson we are going to run the installation of all packages on our application inside our container.

We will run the command "npm install" to get all package dependencies for our application.


1. Open the "dockerfile"
2. At the end of the file type the next command

	RUN npm install

	RUN --> will let us execute some commands into our container


3. build your image again
		
	docker build -t react-app .

4. Run your container into an interactive way

	docker run -it react-app sh

5. Apply "ls" command on "/app" path to see the node_modules directory created due to our "RUN" command.


Now you already know how to run commands into your container, Well done!!!
