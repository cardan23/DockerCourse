Copying files and directories


We are going to add some commands to docker file to copy files and directories from our app to our docker container.

FROM node:alpine3.22

WORKDIR /app 
COPY . .



WORKDIR  ---> will create the directory if not exist and will go to that path
COPY . . ---> On this command we are telling docker... "copy all files on the application to the current path (which is /app)"

ADD ---> add command have the same usage of copy command with some differences:
	1. It can to decompress a compressed file inside docker 

		Example: ADD myZipFile.zip /app/myDecompressedFile

	2. Add a file from a url to our container

		Example: ADD http://.../file.json /downloaded/file.json


Now you can build again your image and run it into interactive mode to check if files and directories were copied

1. docker build -t react-app .
2. docker run -it react-app sh 
3. Apply "ls" command on "/app" path and check if all application files are there (everything should be there fine).



On the next lesson we will learn to exclude some files and directories, Well done!!!
