Sample Web Application

This is an exercise just to identify what we need to do for running an application on our host without Docker.


1. Install nodejs on your computer 
2. Please check and open the "section4-react-app" directory on visual code.
3. Open a terminal window and go to this path directory "section4-react-app"
4. Execute next command:
	
	npm install

5. Execute the start command:
	
	npm start

6. Open your application on "localhost:3000"
7. Done, you will see the react app running.


Those are the steps, as you can see consume a lot of memory with packages and a lot of time to installation and run.

On the next lesson we will "Dockerize" this application to make it easier.


Well, done you already run it an application on your local environment!!!
