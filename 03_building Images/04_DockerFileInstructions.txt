Docker File Instructions


The first step to "Dockerize" an application is adding the "dockerFile" (with no extension file) to the project and add some commands to apply changes to be able to run our application with Docker.

On the file we can find the next "Docker" commands:

FROM
	This is to specify the base image we are going to use and work over it

WORKDIR
	Set the working directory we are using on our application

COPY
	Copy some files/directories to container

ADD
	Add some files/directories to container

RUN
	This is to executing operating system commands on the container, all learned Linux commands can be executed in docker with it

ENV
	Setting environment variables

EXPOSE
	Expose some port number on container

USER
	For specify the user should run the application, we are going to run the application with a user with limited permissions

CMD
	For specify what command will be executed when we start the container

ENTRYPOINT
	For specify what command will be executed when we start the container



We will see all those commands in a deeper way in next lessons.


You already know a base of "Docker" commands, well done!!!
