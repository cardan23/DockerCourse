Saving and loading images

In this lesson we are going to learn about how to save docker images on a file.


Docker save

	On docker we have a command which is "docker save" this command let us save our image into a file and let us take that file and share it with anyone we need.

	docker image save -o <nameOfTheFile> <nameOfTheImage>

	-o ---> (output) we are asking docker write in a file

	<nameOfTheFile>  ---> name of the file we are going to create with our image

	<nameOfTheImage> ---> name of the image we are going to save

	Based on above, please apply the next command:


	docker image save -o react-app.tar carlosavilc/react-app:3


Once the command end the process please check if the file was created, you should have a .tar file with the name you specified.


Now, we are going to load that file and get the image with docker.

1. Remove all docker images about react-app to avoid confusion.
2. Apply next command

	docker image load -i react-app.tar
	
	-i ---> Read from tar archive file

3. List your docker images 

	docker images

4. Check we have our docker image carlosavilc/react-app:3 into the list



You have saved and loaded a docker image, well done!!!
