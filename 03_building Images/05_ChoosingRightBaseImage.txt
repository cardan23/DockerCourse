Choosing the right base image


We are going to add the dockerfile to our application and follow next instructions:

1.  Add the next command inside of it

	FROM node:alpine3.22

	note: "alpine" is a very light version of Linux, that is the reason we are choosing this one.


2. Open the terminal window and Create an image 
	
	docker build -t react-app .

	-t --> tagging our image as "react-app"
	.  --> tell docker where it can find our docker file, in this case dot means into the same directory


3. Now to run your container in a interactive way please type next command
	
	docker run -it react-app sh




Note: You can find samples of images depending of the project to have, you can take a look on this link: 
	
	https://docs.docker.com/reference/samples/




You have downloaded your image and run your container, Well done!!!
