What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for building, running and shipping applications. No matter the language nor the framework.

A clear example its when we are building and running our application on local or dev environment, everything
is working as expected, the issues comes when we pass that application to another environment like QA, UAT, Stage,
even Production. On those "new" environments for our application the are some missing software, dependencies and versions
of needed software. There are a lot of reasons our application could fail due to missing dependencies on the environment.
For that reason Docker creates a package to have same dependencies and versions of software we should use for our app and 
resolve the issues mentioned before.

For example if we need node 18 version, Mongo 4 version on our application, with docker we can create a package to have
all these versions on a single package. With this package we can replicate all necessary to any environment.

Another good example is when a new team member joins to our project, instead of passing a lot of time setting up
all dependencies, libraries or needed software into their local environment, we just pass the docker package to start
and make easy all this process.

Another advantage using docker is having different applications on the same environment (local, QA, Production, etc.)
If we need different versions on two applications we can have two packages with necessary software for each one.

As a final example of good use of docker is removing our package for our application once we don't need it anymore,
letting free space for another application.

All of these are we advantages using docker.

So.... Lets get started!!
