Docker workflow

	The process for "Dockerize" an application with any platform or any language programming is the next one:

	1. Add a docker file to the application.

		This is a plain text file with instructions that docker uses to package the application into an image.
		The image contains everything necessary for running our application.

		For example this image could include:
			1. A cut-down Operative System
			2. A runtime environment (eg. Node, Python, .Net, etc)
			3. Application files
			4. Third-party libraries
			5. Environment variables

	2. Once we have the image, we tell docker to use that image into a docker container. 
	   Instead of running the application directly into our computer or environment we run it into a docker container,
 	   with this the application is isolated and dependencies or requirements cannot affect other applications.



	With this process we can have our application into a package and replicate into different environments running docker.
	We pass the image to QA/Prod server and docker container into this environment will run it.


	Well done!!! You can understand now the docker workflow!!!
