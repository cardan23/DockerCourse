FROM node:alpine ----> "node:alpine" its an lightweight image on docker repository with node js integrated (link node image: https://hub.docker.com/_/node)

COPY . /app ----> it means copy all files into /app folder

WORDIR /app ----> go to /app directory/folder

CMD node app.js ---> run node "app.js" file


After having this file we will build the docker package.

	1. Open a terminal window, go to the path where we have the docker file into the application and type the next command:
		
		docker build -t hello-docker .

	2. After apply this command, to check if our image has been created we can type the next command on terminal window
		
		docker image ls 

	   This will give the list of all images created with docker, we will see something like next:

		REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
		hello-docker     latest    b64e27bd405c   2 minutes ago   153MB

	Now we have our image created with docker we can move it to docker hub repository and use it into another computer
	Let's do the next exercise.


	1. open docker.com
	2. Create an account and login into it
	3. Go to repositories
	4. Create a repository
	5. Add a repository name and short description
	6. Click on create
	7. Go to labs.play-with-docker.com
	8. create an account an log in into it
	9. Start button
	10. Click on "Add new instance"
		we are creating a new virtual machine for free. This virtual machine only has Linux and docker installed

	11. Type "docker version" on this new virtual machine to check the docker version installed
	12. Then type "docker pull <nameOfDockerImage>" in my case is... carlosavilc/hello-docker
		
		This command will download the docker image previously created on docker hub repository

	13. run the next command "docker image ls"
		This command will show the all the list images
	14. run the next command
		docker run <nameOfDockerImage>
		
		In my case is... docker run carlosavilc/hello-docker

	15. This will run our application into our new docker container.
