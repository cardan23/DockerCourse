Windows 10+ ships with a Linux kernel. So when using Docker, you can choose between Windows or Linux containers. Windows containers (processes) need to talk to the Windows kernel under the hood. Linux containers need the Linux kernel.

These are essentially two different isolated worlds. You can choose between these two worlds by right-clicking on the Docker icon in the notification tray (in the bottom status bar).

Remember: the images and containers in the Windows world are invisible to the Linux world. You'd need Windows containers only if you need an image that starts from Windows.
