Virtual Machines VS Docker platform

	Virtual machine
		This is an abstract way to have resources for a not real computer inside a real one.

		For example we could have a physical "Mac" computer and have running 2 virtual machines one with Microsoft and the other one with Linux version.

		How its possible to do that?
		well, to be able to run virtual machines on a physical computer its necessary to use an "Hypervisor" software, this could be "VMware", "Virtual box" or Hyper-V (only for Windows).

		Advantages
			- The main advantage for virtual machines is the isolation of each virtual machine, we can isolate applications on each virtual machines.
			- We can delete the virtual machine once we don't need it any more.
			- Move the virtual machines to another physical computer.		

		Disadvantages
			- Virtual machines use a real copy of the operative system (Windows, Mac, Linux)
			- Takes resources from the physical machine (CPU, RAM memory, disk, etc, a lot of resources and intensive).
			- Slow to start

	Docker container

		Similar to virtual machines about the isolation of applications but even better, let check all the advantages.

		Advantages
			- Allow to run multiple applications in isolation
			- Docker containers are lightweight
			- Use Operative system of the host
			- Start quickly
			- Need less hardware resources
			- We dont need to specify the number of cpu cores, memory or space.
