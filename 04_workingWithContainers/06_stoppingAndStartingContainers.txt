Stopping and starting containers


The command to stopping a container is the next one:

	docker stop <containerId or containerName>

	docker stop blue-sky


The command to start a container is the next one:

	docker start <containerId or containerName>
	
	docker start blue-sky


The difference between "run" and "start":

	We use "docker run" when we want to create a new container from an image.

	We use "docke start" when we have the container created and stopped.



Well done, you have stopped and started a container!!!
