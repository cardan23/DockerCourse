Executing commands in running containers


We already saw how to run our container and execute some commands at the beginning of the run, but now if we want to execute some commands into a running container we can do it with next command:

	docker exec <containerID or containerName> <AnyComandHere>

	docker exec blue-sky ls

You will see the list of files and directories into our application, this is due to the working directory defined on our "dockerfile" was "/app" directory.


We can execute any command we want, another example is the next one:

	 docker exec -it blue-sky sh

That previous command open the terminal of the container wit interactive mode, you can exit from it using the "exit" command.



Well done, you have executed a command into a running container
