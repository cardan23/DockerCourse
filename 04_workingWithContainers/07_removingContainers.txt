Removing containers


We can remove containers like next ways:

	
	1. docker container rm <containerId or containerName>

	2. docker rm  <containerId or containerName>


These previous commands works the same way, the first one is the large way and the second one the short way.


To force to remove a container, we can do it with the "-f" option:

	docker rm  -f blue-sky


Now to clean docker and remove all the stopped containers, we can use the "prune" command:

	docker prune



Great, you already know how to remove a container!!!
