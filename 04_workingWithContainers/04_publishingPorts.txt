Publishing ports


As we mentioned on the previous module we are going to see how to publish/bind ports between the container and the host.


We can publish the port at the same time to run our container like this:


	docker run -d -p <host port>:<container port> --name <containerName> <imageName>


	Example:
	
	docker run -d -p 2000:3000 --name blue-sky react-app


Now with this command please list all the running containers and you will notice something like next:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                         NAMES
8ec75e44c525   react-app   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   4 seconds ago    Up 2 seconds    0.0.0.0:2000->3000/tcp, [::]:2000->3000/tcp   blue-sky


As you can see on the PORTS column we can see the mapping between the host and the container. Now you can go to the explorer and go the site localhost:2000 to see if our application is running.


You have mapped the port on your container, well done!!!
