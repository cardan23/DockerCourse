Starting containers

As we create on previous module the image to be able to run our docker container, we will use the next command about  "react-app" image:

	docker run <nameOfImage>

	docker run react-app


This previous way will run docker container but we cannot use the terminal window to add or type more commands if we need.
For that reason we have an option "-d" (detached) which used to run our docker container in background task and be able to use the terminal window for more commands, please check next example:


	docker run -d <nameOfImage>

	docker run -d react-app


Now list your docker containers on the terminal like this:


	docker ps


As you can see docker assign a random name to our container for us, but if we want to add a specific name we should use the "--name" option and add the name we want.


	docker run -d --name <nameOfContainer> <nameOfImage>

	docker run -d --name blue-sky react-app


After this process check if your container is running in background with next command:

	docker ps




Well done, you have run a container in a background mode, congrats!!!
