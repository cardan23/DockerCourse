Manipulating files and directories on Linux

	To create directories (folders) and Files on Linux we can use next commands:

	- mkdir <name>                     --> creates a folder/directory with specified name
	- mv <name> <new name/new path>    --> rename or move files and folders
	- touch <name1> <name2> <name3> ... --> creates file(s) with specified name
	- rm <name1> <name2> <name3> ...   --> removes file(s) with specified name


	As an exercise please do the next:
	
	1. go home path
	2. create a folder
	3. go inside that new folder
	4. create a lot of files
	5. remove some of them files
	6. go back the folder
	7. remove the folder


	Well done!!! You have used a lot of commands from Linux operating system!!!
