Redirection
	When we use "cat" to see the content of a file, Linux is getting the content of the file and sending it to the screen, we call to 	this process redirection.

	We can redirect the "cat" content from a file into another with the next way:
		
		cat file1.txt > file2.txt

		> ---- this symbol means to send the information cat get to another file.

	We can concatenate the files into another one like this:
		
		cat file1.txt file2.txt > combinedfile.txt
	
		This will send all on file1 and file2 to combinedfile.txt

	You can redirect any command result into a text file:

	As a final exercise try this:
		
		ls -l /etc > longlist.txt

		you will see the result of list of all files into /etc folder on the longlist.txt file.


Great!!! You now know how to use the redirection symbol (>) on Linux, well done!!
