Managing Users

We are going to learn some commands in Linux to manage users.


	useradd ---> Adding a user
	usermod ---> modify a user
	userdel ---> delete a user

	As we already know if we want to know more about a command, the "help" command on Linux could help:

	The next command will show the parameters or options we can use with the command	

	useradd --help


We will add a user with a home directory with next command:

	1. useradd -m dany

	-m ---> means create the home directory to new user

	2. now execute next command to see the created user
		
		cat /etc/passwd
		
	You will see something similar to this at the end of the file:

		dany:x:1001:1001::/home/dany:/bin/sh

	As we can see this user contains next text at the end of the line

		dany:/bin/sh

	This means will use the shell original program when this user login.

	3. We will modify the shell original to bash with next command

		usermod -s /bin/bash dany

		-s ---> option to modify the shell

	4. We execute cat to passwd file to see if we already modify it

		cat /etc/passwd

		We will see something like this:

		dany:x:1001:1001::/home/dany:/bin/bash

	5. In the /etc directory we have the a passwords files, only available for root user

		cat /etc/shadow

		On this files we can see users and passwords in encrypted format.

	6. Open another teminal on visual code and type the next command to run the container with the new user:

		docker exec -it -u dany 6ba3f9873246 bash

		6ba3f9873246 ---> this is the id of the container process, you should change it for the id you have.


	7. You should see something similar to this

		dany@6ba3f9873246:~$

		if you try to see the password file, you should get an error due to "dany" is not a root user, and doesn't have permission.

		Something like this and will be fine:

		cat /etc/shadow
		cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
		
		

Well done!!, now you learned about user managing on Linux, keep going we are on the correct way!!!
