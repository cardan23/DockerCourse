Running Linux with Docker

	we have some commands to know on docker and be able to run our images lets see some of these commands:

	- docker pull <nameOfImage>

		example: docker pull ubuntu

		This command will download from docker hub repository (hub.docker.com) the "ubuntu" image to our environment.

	- docker run <nameOfImage>

		example: docker run ubuntu

		This command will run the docker image.

		Note: In case the image doesn't exist on local environment, docker run command will pull it automatically
		from docker repository and will download it.

	- docker ps
		
		This command will show the list of docker processes (containers) running into our environment.

	- docker ps -a
		
		This command will show the list of all docker processes (containers) running and not running into our environment.
	
	-docker run -it <nameOfImage>

		example: docker run -it ubuntu

		This command will let us run the image into interactive mode (it). With this will show the terminal window of our ubuntu
		image running.

		Once inside of the Ubuntu terminal, we can play with some Linux commands like next ones:

		cd <path>               --> go to some path
		mkdir <nameOfTheFolder> --> create a folder
		pwd                     --> print on the screen the actual path
		ls                      --> show the list of files and folders on the actual path
		whoami                  --> show the name of the user we are logged in
		

Important to Know: Linux is a case sensitive operating system, it is not the same type "Docker" than "docker", so please be careful and check the correct way to apply commands.


You already know some Linux commands, Well done!!!
