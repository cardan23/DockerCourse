Managing Processes


A process is an instance of a running program.

To see all the running programs or all the running processes we can use the next command:

	ps  --> means process

	we will see something like this

	PID TTY          TIME CMD
	1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  	526 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

	bash --> is a process (means Bourne-Again SHell) its the program we are using as terminal and Linux command execution
	

We are going to create a process and kill it, this just to know how to do it:

Creating a process and executing on background:

	sleep 3 --> the prompt will wait 3 seconds and return again

	To put it on background we will add the ampersand at the end
	
	sleep 3 & --> the prompt will wait 3 seconds and return again, but this process will be done on background 

	To have time for this exercise we will set 100 seconds like next:

	1. sleep 100 & 

	2. we will execute "ps" command to check the processes, we will see something similar to next:

		PID TTY          TIME CMD
		1   pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  		534 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep
  		535 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

	3. Kill the process applying next command, kill command to kill the process and 535 is the ID of the process:

		kill 535




Well done!! You already learned what is a process and how to kill them on Linux!!!
