Finding files and directories

We can search and find files and directories on Linux with some commands and make our work easier like below:

the "find" command can help us with the task to find files and directories.

	
	for example next command:

	find /etc --> will show all the files and directories stating from /etc


filtering the result

	find -type d ---> find only directories "d" into current path

	find -type f ---> find only files "f" into current path

	find -type f -name "f*" ---> find all files with name starting with "f"

	find -type f -iname "f*" ---> find all files with name starting with "f" (-i, means case insensitive)


Exercise:

	Find all python files and write the result into a files called "pythonFiles.txt"


Solution

	find / -type f -name "*.py" > ~/pythonFiles.txt

	/      --> starting from root path 
	"*.py" --> python extension file
	>      --> redirection operator, in this case will redirect to a file
	~      --> home path
