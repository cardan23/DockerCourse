Linux distributions

	As you maybe already know "Linux" is an open source operative system and there are a lot of different versions or variants of Linux, we call to these variants of Linux as "distributions".

	Some Linux distributions:
	
	- Ubuntu
	- Fedora
	- Debian
	- Alpine
	- CentOS
	
	For our next practices we will use the Ubuntu distribution, if you want to use another distribution is totally fine.


	Now you already know what is a Linux distribution, well done!!!
