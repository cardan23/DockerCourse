Linux File system
	On this section we will let you know what is the Linux file system structure and a brief description of each part.

	As you maybe know windows has the next structure:
	
		C:\
		  --Program files
		  --Windows

	So on Linux we have something similar, but the big difference is on Linux everything is a file, described below. 
		
		/ -- root
		  bin -- binary files
		  boot -- files about booting system
		  dev -- devices (everything is a file even devices)
		  etc -- configuration files (etc means "editable text configurations")
		  home -- home directory for users, each user on linux will have their own home directory
		  root -- home directory only for root user
		  lib -- library files software dependencies
		  var -- variable, on this path we have file which are changing or updating frecuently like lock files, application files, etc.
		  proc -- process, directory which contains processes on linux system (everything is a file even processes).
