Managing Groups

Just like user we have similar commands for groups, but What is a group?

A group on Linux is a set of users with same permissions, we can define all permissions we consider necessary into a group and assign users to that group. This will make that the user will have specified permissions previously added to the group. 


Create a new group

	groupadd <nameOfGroup>

Modify a group 
	
	groupmode <nameOfGroup>

Remove a group
	
	groupdel <nameOfGroup>


We re going to create a group called "developers" and assign the user "dany" to this new goup:

	1. groupadd developers
	2. usermod -G developers dany
		
		-G ---> this means assign this user to a supplementary group

	3. to check if was already created we can execute the next command:
		
		cat /etc/group | grep dany

		we will see something similar to next line:

			dany:x:1001:
			developers:x:1002:dany

		Or we can check with next way too:

			grep dany /etc/passwd

		We will get something similar to next:
	
			dany:x:1001:1001::/home/dany:/bin/sh


Exercise:
	
	please create a new group called "artists" and assign the user "dany" to this new created group.


Solution:
	1. groupadd artists
	2. usermod -G developers,artists dany
	3. check if is already created and assigned: cat /etc/group | grep dany
		
		You will see something similar to next:

		dany:x:1001:
		developers:x:1002:dany
		artists:x:1003:dany


Well done now!!! you can manage groups on Linux, this is a basic way but we will fine with this for now, Congratulations!!!
