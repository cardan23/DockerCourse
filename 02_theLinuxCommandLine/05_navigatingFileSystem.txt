Navigating Linux file system
	
	We will walk on the Linux file system now.

	A common command to use on Linux is:
	
		-- pwd (print working directory) which will show the current path where we are, very very useful, please remember it.

		-- ls (list) will show the list of files and directories on the path we are.

		-- ls -l (list long view) we can see size of elements, permissions, created date, etc.

		-- cd (current directory) this command is useful to change or move into directories on Linux.


		Relative path
			begins from the path we are into the moment, if we are on root path we only type 
			
			cd boot
			
			To go into boot path (notice we are not including "/" path)

		Absolute path
			always begins from root path, example:
			
			/boot

		Go one level up on path
			cd ..

		Go two level up on path
			cd ../..

		Go to root path
			cd /

		Go to home directory (works for any user)
			cd ~

	Now is your turn, play and explore with these commands.



Well done!! You now know some useful commands on Linux!!!
