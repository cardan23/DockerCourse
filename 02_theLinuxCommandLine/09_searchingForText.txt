Searching for text

	"grep" command will help us to find or search for some text into a file, "grep" means "global regular expression print".

	Try the next command to find the word "hello" on file.txt:

		grep -i hello file.txt 

		-i, this means case insensitive

		this command will mark in red the word if its find it.

	We can use regular expressions too.

		grep -i hello file*

		we are searching the word "hello" on every file which their name starts with "file."

	We can search recursively into a folder.

		grep -i -r hello . --> -r means recursively, we can use it on a directory
 		grep -ir hello . --> same as command above
		
		here we are searching for "hello" word, recursebly into current directory
